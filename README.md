## Problem Statement

I am looking to build a regression model to predict the amount of revenue a movie will make based on its metadata. My model performance will be judged based on RMSE, and I am hoping to improve upon my baseline score calculated by guessing the mean of every movie's revenue every time by at least 15 percent.
